# testing  and filehandling

inihandler.py is a class i often used during my foxpro-days, 
so i recreated it in python (but it's much easier in python, 
as most of the functionality is built in :-D )

with that you can read and write nice .ini-files 

tests provided, too of cause

api_calls.py is just the refined api-example i represented during 
our exercises, today...have fun playing with it

the folder 'from_exercises'...well it's selfexplainairy...
it's my version of the exercises and it's test from todays lession.
